### Path of the Kensei
_3rd-level Kensei feature (enhances Path of the Kensei)_

When you choose this tradition at 3rd level, your special martial arts training leads you to master the use of certain weapons. This path also includes instructions in the deft strokes of calligraphy or painting. You gain the following benefits:

**Kensei Weapons**. Choose two types of weapons to be your kensei weapons: one melee weapon and one ranged weapon. Each of these weapons can be any simple or martial weapon that lacks the heavy and special properties. The longbow is also a valid choice. You gain proficiency with these weapons if you don't already have it. Weapons of the chosen types are monk weapons for you. Many of this tradition's features work only with your kensei weapons. When you reach 6th, 11th, and 17th level in this class, you can choose another type of weapon&mdash;either melee or ranged&mdash;to be a kensei weapon for you, following the criteria above.

_At your option, one of your kensei weapons may have the heavy property and deal piercing or slashing damage. If you select a weapon with these properties you may only choose one kensei weapon at 3rd level._

For the Kensei, re-skin the glaive (slashing) as a _naginata_, and the pike (piercing) as a _fluttering dƒÅo_.

**Agile Parry**. If you make an unarmed strike as part of the Attack action on your turn and are holding a kensei weapon, you can use it to defend yourself if it is a melee weapon. You gain a _bonus to AC equal to your proficiency modifier_ until the start of your next turn, while the weapon is in your hand and you aren't incapcitated.

**Kensei's Shot**. You can use a bonus action on your turn to make your ranged attacks with a kensei weapon more deadly. When you do so, any target you hit with a ranged attack using a kensei weapon takes an extra 1d4 damage of the weapon's type. You retain this benefit until the end of the current turn.

**Way of the Brush**. You gain proficiency with your choice of calligrapher's supplies or painter's supplies.

### Elegant Courtier
_6th-level Kensei feature (enhances Path of the Kensei)_

_Starting at 6th level, your discipline and attention to detail allow you to excel in social situations. Whenever you make a Charisma (Persuasion) check, you gain a bonus to the check equal to your Wisdom modifier._

_Your self-control also causes you to gain proficiency in Wisdom saving throws. If you already have this proficiency, you instead gain proficiency in Intelligence or Charisma saving throws (your choice)._

### One with the Blade

At 6th level, you extend your ki into your kensei weapons, granting you the following benefits.

**Magic Kensei Weapons**. Your attacks with your kensei weapons count as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.

**Deft Strike**. When you hit a target with a kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to cause the weapon to deal extra damage to the target equal to your Martial Arts die. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.

_**Precise Strike**._ _(Enhances One with the Blade). When you make a melee attack with a Kensei weapon, you can spend 1 ki point to attack with advantage. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns._ 


### Sharpen the Blade

At 11th level, you gain the ability to augment your weapons further with your ki. As a bonus action, you can spend up to 3 ki points to grant one kensei weapon you touch a bonus to attack and damage rolls when you attack with it. The bonus equals the number of ki points you spent. This bonus lasts for 1 minute or until you use this feature again. This feature has no effect on a magic weapon that already has a bonus to attack and damage rolls.

### Unerring Accuracy

At 17th level, your mastery of weapons grants you extraordinary accuracy. If you miss with an attack roll using a monk weapon on your turn, you can reroll it. You can use this feature only once on each of your turns.
